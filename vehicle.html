          The left diagram shows the trip purposes for private vehicle transport. Commuting is the main reason to travel to Melbourne City. As shown in the heat map, the pattern of travel time is aligned with the working hours in weekdays. There is significant traffic stress especially during rush hours from 6am to 9am. In contrast, the travel pattern in weekend is evenly distributed without obvious peak time. The urban transportation system needs to cope the flexible demand for Private Vehicle.

      These two bar charts show the distribution of travel distances by private vehicle on weekday and weekend, with classified trip purposes. As the amount of travel is significantly reduced beyond the peak range between 20km to 24.9km, it is implied that the residents who live within 25km from city are willing travel to city by private vehicle. Also, only a few survey respondents travel more than 100 km to city by private vehicle. The switch of travel purposes in weekday and weekend has also been identified.
